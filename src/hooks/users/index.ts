/**
 * User Hooks
 *
 * IMPORTANT: All user operations are now available in monolithic hooks:
 * - useWildduckUsers (collection-level: list, create)
 * - useWildduckUser (singular-level: get, update, delete, and ALL settings)
 *
 * The specialized user hooks have been removed. Use the monolithic hooks instead.
 */

// No individual user hooks - all consolidated into useWildduckUser and useWildduckUsers
